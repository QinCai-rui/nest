# Nest

![Nest Logo](/brand/logo.png)

**A free Linux server for teenagers from Hack Club!**

Basic problem for us to solve: many teenagers literally can't deploy any backend services right now because they don't have credit cards or income and most hosting free tiers have disappeared (looking at you Heroku ðŸ˜”). We want to change that! As a public good! _Nest is a revamp of Hack As a Service ([v0](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service-v0), [v1](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service))_

To sign up for Nest, see our [Quickstart](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Quickstart) guide.

Nest's configuration is documented in [SETUP.md](/SETUP.md), and its brand is in [the brand directory](/brand/).
